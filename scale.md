We will need a better server with more processing power and memory.
Move our server to the cloud. Amazon Web Services is a good option.
The largest number of processes must be asynchronous.
Keep the minimum data in cookie session.
Static data must be cached.
Analyze queries based on data, create indexes in necessary tables and make traces to obtain valuable information.
