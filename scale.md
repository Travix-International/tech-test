# Scale
For optimisation there should be indexes for Name and Description properties of Product and Category. Also there might be several load balance servers for database and several application servers. Some operations like calculating tax, discount and sum of price, also filtering inside shopping cart might be performed in client side for not loading servers with that operations. Also if discount and tax processing rules are basic enough they might be denormalised and joined with Product table.For further optimisation I need detailed info about system. For example if domain is airline tickets graph databases might be used to find shortest and cheepest tickets to destination. But I did not designed this shopping cart solution for special domein.
