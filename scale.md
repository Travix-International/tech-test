# Scale (Simple shopping cart system)

I think, there should be more developers for support all parts of development in case of big amount of card applications users.
Also in application view should be added paging or loading items with content scrolling. Maybe divide content in more containers(pages).
In future saparating servers for front-end and backend.  Maybe creating separated mudules with it's own backend/front-end. Each module could have a team with designers/developers/managers.
Using Agile methotology for managing teams work. Having place for conversations and communications in and between teams members (skype, slack etc)
