# Scale
Scaling up the system is to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources are added. 
For small and medium businesses, two modes of system architecture can be implemented:
The first one is vertical scaling, which is developing the system in a manner that allows adding hardware (processing power and memory) and software resources to the server as required, increasing its capacity and power for server-related operations. The other type is horizontal scaling, and it involves developing the system for horizontal scalability, which allows the addition of new computers, nodes, or units to the system, enabling it to work as one logical circuit. This means that processing power is added with each new unit.

When it comes to Big Data and high traffic applications as in our case:
There are various ways for handling big data and high-traffic applications, such as in adding a load balancer for example elastic load balancer, connecting multiple zones in one region through low latency links and distributing incoming application traffic and splitting static files on multiple services and servers for easier and faster handling and maintenance. This architecture is known as Multi Servers and it works by adjusting the capacity and resources to meet traffic demands.
The second architecture is the MicroServices architecture, which is developing the applications independently as a set of small, deployable and modular services that run unique processes and communicate through a lightweight mechanism. Also we can use the load balancer to redirect the traffic to the new small service instead of the main app. Repeat this process as many time as needed to create new micro services There are various benefits to this method, and they include the low impact on other services, high potential for scalability, and the ability to build large and complex systems composed of small services that deliver the functionality corresponding to a single feature.

 The High-Availability, Multi-Region deployment of the system ensures minimizing the downtime of services to nil, and guarantees 100% operability. Coupled with multi-region architecture, it works by scaling up the system across availability regions based on the source of the traffic. If noticed that a significant amount of traffic is coming from two different regions maybe itâ€™s the time to make the app available there 
Auto Scaling, which acts to adjust the processing based on the load of incoming application traffic, therefore utilizing CPU power and reducing operational costs. 
Using Metrics in order properly and comprehensively monitor and centralize logging of all events in the applications. This also helps in determining server nodes in case of system failures or downtimes, and saves the time and effort that would be spent on logging on to each node.
