# Scale

Since this application will be hosted on Azure App Service, it will be able to:

* Scale vertically: switching to an other plan with more cores and RAM
* Scale horizontally (can be automated): adding more instances of the App Service
*  Since we use Redis for storing sessions and reading the content of the cart, we will be able to handle traffic peaks more smoothly

Quick FYI, my practical experience in scalability is limited but I am very interested in gaining technical knowledge. I am currently taking courses on Pluralsight on Azure, .NET Core and NoSQL.
