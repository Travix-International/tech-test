# Scale

Since we are designing an architecture based in REST APIs it would be possible to scale up or out depending the requirements and what is available.

Based on the solution proposed the database could also be a case to evaluate on scale, and this can also be done, depending on the requirements, with techiques like database replication or database partition.
