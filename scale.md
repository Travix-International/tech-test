# Scale
There are a couple of alternatives that we can follow:

- We can leverage Autoscaling with AWS
- Move the server infra from Vertical Scaling to Horizontal Scaling
- At this point, it's probably better to have the database in another server too
- Consider moving static files (such as css, html and images) to CDN servers
