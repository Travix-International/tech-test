# Scale

1. The backend should be placed behind a load balancer;
2. We should use CDN for static contents, like images, javascript files, etc.;
3. We should use a scalable cloud hosting, like Microsoft Azure.
4. HTTP caching
5. In-memory database, like Redis, to reduce SQL Database call;
6. The backend application could be splitted, using microservices architecture;
