# Scale
The system will be initially installed on a single server. All session information will be managed in memory. Then, with the expansion, the session data will be converted from a memory to a non-relational database (like MongoDB) to a multi-server structure. The servers will connect with a Load Balancer. Each request will be directed to the random (least dense) server. Since the servers do not keep session information in memory, they will read from the non-relational database they need. If a relational database is used as the main database, database settings will be made in the context of a DBA. (paging, tempdb location, index definition and maintenance etc.)
