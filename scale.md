# Scale

1. NoSQL will be nice alongside NodeJS and Redis. I am not expert on this, hence; the non-suggestion. But a Caching will be necesary, to be honest at this stage I should have included in the solution.
2. A bit of Business features, Analytics will be nice. Option to ad advertisements timely skippable, option to choose the short URL.
3. Introduce API to create shorts
4. Another way of looking at it, simple straight .. come up with Hashing algorithm usiing a Key that generates the same equilivent characters if same key is used .. in this case; DB will not be required to map shorts and longs .. Oneshot and expiry could be handled as additional parmeters (hashed) in the short URL .. (which will be a bit long actually) in favor of removing DB from the equation ..
