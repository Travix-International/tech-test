# Scale

The solution need minimum 3 machines and its scalable as Each layer is distributed cluster, 

so based on load Cache Layers can be increased, they are something like CDN so even can he 100's of nodes possible

Origin server can be cluster as well as they are distributed DB’s which only perform search on data they have  

Master can be one per Region or maybe one big , Master functionality can be split in multiple small micro services , like one for managing real time Fares , one for push notifications etc.…
