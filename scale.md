1.	Cloud (Azure or AWS) is used to host the database and web services.
2.	Nodes are added to the MongoDB if needed to scale.
3.	Processing power, bandwidth and the storage limits can be increased in the clouds based on the storage.
4.	MongoDB auto scales.
5.	Geo redundancy for the database and web services are possible in the cloud.
