# Questions

1. How many total urls we are going to have? 

2. What characters can be used in hash?

_These two are important, because the hash/short url size depends on this. _

3. Can user update or delete previously created short urls? 

4. Are you sure that you want to shorthen the POST requests too?

_The main reason of URL shortening is for Sharing data ( it first used for tweets then for sms and emails ). I think that POST requests are against the nature of URL shortening. Of course it can be done but is it worth it? I think no. Posting data on behalf of user/customer seems pretty hacky for me.  I'm not pretty sure if it's a trap or something else but I'll use my chance and skip it. _
