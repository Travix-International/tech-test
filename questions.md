# Questions

- Can people join without oauth-ing through other services and just via their email or phone number?
- How do users find each other? Is there a recommendation system or we import it from their address book?
- How do users connect with each other? Is it a typical social network model where users request/approve each other or they just follow public stream and have private messages between followers like twitter?
- If the user has been away, should we just remind him how many days he has not posted? 
- If the user is inactive for more than a month, should his account be labeled inactive?
- Will everyone be able to see the image metadata that we collect?
- I'm not sure what you mean by "Post for you" in the location tracking(point #3 in the list), should the app post the user location when they travel or other users can just see their friend's location?
- Can a user's post be reshared/rebloged?
