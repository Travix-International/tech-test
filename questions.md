# Questions

1.	As I think that the fares are changing several times a day, why should we retain the cache up to 48 hours?
2.	Is scalability enough? 
3.	What are the other factors which would affect scalability?
4.	How important is it to update the cache and so the fare based on the TTL index parameter or frequency of the route search?
5.	Is MongoDB a good choice or do we need some other database like Cassandra or Redis?
6.	Is caching site specific or region specific?
