# Questions

- Is it legal, in all the regions Trawiller is available, to automatically post user location (even with his/her consent)?
- Do we explain to the user that any metadata of the content that is uploaded will be extracted? If, then how?
- Does the company's policy allow to store any kind of data in a third-party data storage (such as Azure cloud)?
- Should we let users configure which data is available to whom? If, then in which granularity?
- What content types is the user allowed to upload?
- What is the maximum allowed file size for upload?
