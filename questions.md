1. We want to keep basket items stored for specific time frame or till user will clear the a browser data (cookies vs localStorage)
2. Should we store basked for logged in users in a DB in case we want to personalized user experience based on selection / unbought products?
3. Are we supporting different configuration? Products in US usually don't have taxes included but in EU they do.
4. Are we supporting different languages? (if yes we will need to specify language code in request to get proper descriptions / names)
5. Do we want to sort products based on user basket / previous selections?
