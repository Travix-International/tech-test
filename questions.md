# Questions
1. I am not 100% sure if the app should be available to the world or only Travix staff or affilliates?
2. Will other Travix services use the Trawiller API to integrate into? e.g. flight booking apps, holiday experience apps
3. What is the time period in which the app needs to be developed and delivered? e.g. milestones, deadlines
4. Should we design the solution based on using a specific cloud platform provider for our backend services or does it have to be more agnostic?
5. Are there wireframe user interface designs available to get a view of the user interface flow of the client side application.
6. Will offensive content automatically be filtered or do we need an administrator interface to moderate content?
7. Related to above, does the app need an administrator interface to allow for functionality such as sending user notifications, serving adverts, blocking accounts, etc
