1. Does authentication (like JWT) be implemented in the URL shortening system, sothat API development will be secure ?
2. URL length limit is 2,083 characters, so how do you plan to handle a really really long GET params ?
3. Will a CDN be used in geographically seperate locations ?
4. It was mentioned that the short URL's be used for security purposes, but its fairly easy to 'lengthify' a short URL to its actual values, how sensitive is the URL's security ?
5. Will there be a 'blacklist' applied, sothat some domains cannot be shortened for security reasons ?
