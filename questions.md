# Questions

Are your sites deployed on AWS, Google Cloud, or any other sort of cloud computing service?
Do we have a limited budget to come up with a solution?
Do we need to have a better granularity of data for some regions than others?
Are your sites focused on some geographical regions, how many sites you have and how popular are each one of them?
Do we need to think in solutions for scaling the fare cache up only, or also some other aspects of the website such as implementing a content delivery network or minifying our code?
