1. What's the difference between 'kind' and 'type'? Could you please give me some examples of an item and its kind and types.
2. What does 'group of items' mean in case of 'remove group of items'? What property is used to groupe them? Only by kind/type? Or could there be some other categories (like 'Flight', 'Hotels', etc)?
3. Does discount depend on consumer country (if you want to work in more that one country)?
4. Is discount applied to each type/kind? Or can it be applied to any groupe of items?
5. Should items be hold in the shopping cart only for authorized customers or for all customers?
6. What content have items?
