## Layout
The starter page will display a home timeline with all posts from people the users follow. Showing top 10 latest posts at time. Every time the user scroll down, older posts will apper, with no limit of time.
The user can click on another user and view the user's timeline, with all posts that user created.
There will be also, a screen for sending and receiving private messages.
All those screen will be available inside a bottom bar or sliding the screen.

## Functionalities
The users will be able to post and send private messages, besides following and blocking users. They also can interact with other posts by replying, like and sharing. All interactions will gather maximum information as possible from user's device (location, model, camera detaisl, etc). They will be able to maintain their profile details.

## Sign up and Sign In
External authenticate will be used. The app/website will only responsible to integrate the services.

Please, see the use case and architecture diagram for a general view of my solution.
