# Solution
To save these URLâ€™s, the user opens a page with instructions, an auto-generated URL and three options: *destination URL*, *Time-to-Live* and *One-Shot*

Instructions:
Define *destination URL*, set the *Time-to-live* time OR *One-Shot* option and access this shortened URL as you would access the destination URL.
Requested method, headers, query parameters and body content will be attached to this short URL.

Accessing the shortened URL with the right method, would redirect the user to the destination URL just as if it was requested with all the query params, headers, etc.
