# Solution.md (Simple shopping cart system)

As a Front-end developer I could imagine this task as multi parent-child
 React component application also with Redux(also react-redux connect and router)
 for handeling data operations in one place.
 Reducers with actions could help to separate data operations for component. View could be a table with filtering, 
 sorting, adding, removing items or list of items in card.
 In root of project will be installed webpack with config for babel(es5 into es6 features) and loaders for styles and scripts compiling.
 After creating a react component it will be tested with Jest library help.
 Images and icons better to implement with svg images type (fonts for icons, .svg for images, or implementing svg to to jsx)
 Development better separate in git repository (github, gitlab, bitbucket etc..) with branch for each feature/task in jira and code review with pull requests.
 Ajax requests will be presented with es6 fetch() functionality with promises. Could be websockets.
