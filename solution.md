+He/she can browse products while on anonymous mode.

+There are 2 user types that inherit user info(Administrator and Customer).

+Administrator can create new product types and products and delete them at will.

+To add products to shopping cart, customer profile must be created. Without this, he/she can only browse the catalogue. 

+Types of products and products can be added to and deleted from shipping cart on variable quantities.

+Shipping details are also included in the order.

+Companies that handle shipping are not considered. Meaning, the design doesn't include separate companies that cover shipping.

+1 Customer could only have 1 shopping cart at most.

+1 customer can have zero or more order(s).
