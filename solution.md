# Solution.md (Simple shopping cart system)

As a Front-end developer I could imagine this task as multi parent-child
 React component application also with Redux(also react-redux connect and router)
 for handeling data operations in one place.
 Reducers with actions could help to separate data operations for component. View could be a table with filtering, 
 sorting, adding, removing items or list of items in card.
