# URL Shortening system.

URL shortening system can be built using the following.

1. An intuitive UI, where the user can paste his long URL and get it converted to a short URL. The web interface interacts with a REST Api to post the URL.

2. The business layer of the application contains logic to generate a unique alphanumeric key, and persist in the database via a data access layer and a repository. A single table will be sufficient to hold this alphanumeric key and the actual URL and link expiry datetime.

3. In-memory or distributed caching should be used in the business layer, so that recent and frequently requested short URLâ€™s can be kept in memory, to reduce the server load. Al algorithm can be used to calculate the frequency of access, and a rank can be calculated to prioritize the caching stack.

4. When a user requests a short URL, the Api gets the data based on the key passed via the URL (like http://shorturl.com/xy123, where xy123 is the key) and gives a Status 301 Moved, with the actual URL, passing all the query/post/headers with the request, so that the user reaches the final site transparently.
