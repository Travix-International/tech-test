# Assumptions

- You can only login via another service (google, facebook, slack, etc)
- Users are allowed to follow each other to see each other's stream. 
- To simplify, there're no private message.s
- Considering its going to track user's location, it has to be on something portable like a phone since mostly on laptops you usually cannot track the location of user while he's not on the site. So assumption is that the focus will be an app.
