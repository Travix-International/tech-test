# Assumptions
The system will make campaign calculations through a 3rd party tool. This tool will be added to the system as a reference and the basic parameters (amount of product price, past sales, etc.) will be posted on this tool as the result of the campaign price.
System tax calculations will also be conducted through a 3rd party tool. As input, product information and amounts will be sent and as output tax amounts will be got.
