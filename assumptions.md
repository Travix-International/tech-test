# Assumptions

- I was going to keep the current cart orders in session or local storage, but when I read "Hold items in the cart across multiple visits to our site", I assumed that maybe the user would like to continue the order through another device.

- I didn't know what kind of discount rules would be applied in the system, so I assumed it would be something the administrator could choose.
