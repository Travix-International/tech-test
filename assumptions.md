# Assumptions

* Initially it will be a pilot project
* you can set web-hooks from Jira, or Trello (if required) - we don’t want to go and keep on polling the updates
* you use github or bitbucket which are connected to Jira or Trello
* Git commits are directly related to the sub-tasks inside Jira or Trello
* you don’t need any payment, until its released as a SAAS product.
* Initially there won’t be much to think about authenticating the post-hooks or web-hooks
