# Assumptions
- AWS infrastructure is available.
- I assume Travix will create new short urls for ticketing, advertise, emailing etc.
- A library will be provided for non-preferred (banned) words for target audience languages.
- It is preferable to not have a dedicated system administrator. Work with as little budget as possible.
