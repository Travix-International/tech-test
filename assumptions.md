Assumptions
===========

 

-   JIRA is expose REST API in order to allow THRESH backend to retrieve
    stories.

-   I assume by feature “**Allow for any number of stories to be added by the
    user**”: is user can add any number of stories to THRESH report, otherwise I
    assume that JIRA expose REST API to create new story.

-   HR Payroll system is REST API in order to allow THRESH backend to retrieve
    needed data like org gram, approved time off, contractual number of hours
    per week, etc.

-   Travix has G Suite account to sign in to [Google Admin console] which is
    needed to establish SSO using SAML
