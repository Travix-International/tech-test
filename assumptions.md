# Assumptions
* Short URLs are going to be generated based on hashes of the full URL
* The hashes will be generated using 62 characters comprised of both lower and uppercase charaters. (A-Z, a-Z, 0-9)
* We don't have any hardware and/or software limitation for the proposed design
* Multiple short URLs may point to the same original URL
