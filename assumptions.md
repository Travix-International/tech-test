# Assumptions (Simple shopping cart system)

It seems to me, that this card should be a separate module, reusable for a lot of other travix applications in different countries with localization.
Also this should support mobile/tablets devices, because a lot of customers using tham also for online shopping.
Webpack with babel for supporting es6 features ( ..., import/export/classes/() => etc).
Jest for unit testing.
Redux for opration with data from server also passing from child to parent. 
Project will use agile technology with, for example, 2 week sprints, userstories and tasks for sprint and demo at the sprint ending.
Better provide code review with pull requests creating. For developers better create code writing rules to make it better be suppoted, understandable for maintainence.
Developers at the beginning of progject should have strict requarement from customer about how shopping card should look and which functionaly have.
