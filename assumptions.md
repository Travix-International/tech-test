# Assumptions

The app will be available to the world.
The client side app can be a mobile app (downloadble from an app store) but can also be accessed from a web browser.
Our stack can make extensive use of Javascript ES6 using Nodejs and Reactjs.
The server environment can be based on container based micro services which can be configured to run within a cloud based platform such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud.
For a queuing service we can use AWS SQS service.
For a caching service we can use AWS Elastic cache service. 
For continous integration we will use a Git repository and link to Jenkins to facilitate our deployments to our cloud services.
