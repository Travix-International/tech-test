# Assumptions
Administrator class is added to design which adds the products and product groups to website.
A wide range of products(from consumer electronics to apparel) will be sold. Thus the site is designed thinking ahead(Maintainable, scalable). 
Discount is based on product, not on the whole cart. For example, there are no discount on total amount, only discount on separate products.
ASP.NET on front end and SQL Server on backend are used. The site is designed using the best practices thus it will be easy to migrate to cloud(possible Microsoft Azure) later. Considering the costs, if the site is a big hit, then it would be logical to migrate.
For the above statement, It is assumed that no regulations against cloud takes place in e-commerce industry.
