# Assumptions

- The backend for the application will be using Microsoft Azure cloud
- Details of authentication/authorization are out of scope, since most popular programming languages have modules/libraries that can be configured
- The first iteration of the system will support images(includeing gifs), texts and location, more features to this will be added in later iteration which include:
  - audio and videos
  - VR and panoramic images
  - excerpts
  - etc.
- It is assumed that the user can only access his/her own timeline in the first iteration, further ability to view other users' timeline can be done in later iterations
- A user cannot edit or delete a post after it is in the system
- Any user with a valid authentication provided is allowed access, there are no restriction that the user should be a member of some group (ex. employee list which may be added later)
