- Url expire time will be configurable by the system admin.
- Editing the url expiry time will not affect the url shortened before editing the expiration time.
- Shortening required authentication and each user will have a profile contains his own unique urls.
- Retrieving the original urls doesn't require authentication.
- Authentication module is out of scope.
