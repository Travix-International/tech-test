# Assumptions
I've assumed that discounts can be given to a certain item as a percentage with an expiration date.

I've assumed users are all already registered 

I've assumed the need of having an history of past orders

I've assumed the bar napkin diagram was not only a joke, so I enjoyed doing it handwritten. :)
