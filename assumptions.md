# Assumptions
1. I assume that this is an open and independent service
2. I assume this system is going to be implemented using any programming language.
3. I assume a domain is registered for this service
4. I assume that the resulting system will be deployed to a cloud platform (eg: AWS, AZURE)
5. I assume that this service will run on a single cloud server pending when traffic velocity increases and require scaling the system to handle huge traffic.
