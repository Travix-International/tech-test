Before I started, I did a research to understand the flights fare system. I realized that a lot of price fluctuation is based more about companies inventory than only flight proximity dates or departure time and this could force fares to change faster than expected.

I'm assuming that, based on a faster fare change pace, we need a short time data expiration and, as informed, because we have roughly 15.000 unique routes and the top variations will be, besides fares, dates, we may have a legacy data base that will keep old flight fares for research and prediction purposes.

I'm also assuming that we have localized and decentralized fare caches for different regions and markets (storage is cheaper than data processing).
